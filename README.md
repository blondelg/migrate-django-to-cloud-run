# Migrate a Django project to cloud run

This aim of this project is to illustrate the main steps to migrate a django project from a classic hosting to a google cloud run hosting.

## How I did it?
[Migrated project's README.md](migrated_project/README.md) explains what to change in [initial project](initial_project/README.md) to have it ready to deploy in cloud run.
